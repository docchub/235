                I have an immense respect for the different mediums storytelling can manifest through. Over the years I've practiced musical performance as well as composition in various genres; I've written comics, and even created interactive stories for my friends through D&D. Part of why I decided to come to RIT was to broaden my range of skills and find the medium with which I could be most satisfied with my own storytelling. Through the bachelor's GDD program I hope to reach, or come closer towards, this goal.
